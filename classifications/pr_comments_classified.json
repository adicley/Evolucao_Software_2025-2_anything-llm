Keep in mind I do not use this tooling daily, nor am I an expert in this\r\n\r\n@timothycarambat - I\u2019d like to propose to introduce an official Helm chart repository for AnythingLLM.\r\n\r\nThe benefit here is that users who want to self-host or deploy to Kubernetes could install and manage AnythingLLM with Helm, which is one of the most common deployment tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, a Helm repository is just a simple HTTP server that hosts an index.yaml file listing available charts ([Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/)). Many open-source projects use GitHub Pages to host this.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nhelm repo add anythingllm-repo https://mintplex-labs.github.io/helm-charts\r\nhelm repo update\r\nhelm install release-name anythingllm-repo/anythingllm --version 1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Proposed approach:**\r\n\r\n- Create a dedicated repo in the _Mintplex-Labs_ org `(e.g. mintplex-labs/helm-charts)`\r\n- Use a `gh-pages` branch to host the index.yaml via GitHub Pages\r\n- Add a GitHub Actions workflow to package charts, publish .tgz files as releases, and update the repo index automatically\r\n- Add the Helm Chart to https://artifacthub.io/ (Think Docker Hub)\r\n\r\nThis pattern is widely adopted across open-source projects.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d be happy to help with this. In my day job I work with Kubernetes across different environments (cloud and on-prem) and I\u2019ve had quite a bit of experience creating and maintaining Helm charts.\r\n\r\nI recently migrated the company I work for from OpenWeb UI to AnythingLLM. The response from the teams after a demo was really positive. I think there\u2019s a lot of potential for AnythingLLM to grow in this space, and having an official Helm chart repo would make adoption even easier for other teams.",

Maybe for the first step I make that empty repo so that the work doesnt get crossed and mixed up between repos and then we can backlink it to the main repo and vice versa.\r\n\r\nReally awesome and I would greatly appreciate the help with that as it is certainly not my domain expertise.\r\n\r\n[Here is the new empty repo if you do have the time to contribute](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/helm-charts) Once we have a YAML to serve Ill enable GH Pages to serve from whatever directory we need to so that it can resolve for users who want to use this service/arch.",

Not a big red failure in chat.\r\n- The idea of doing a pre-check is actually very useful, since all of the providers have a `heartbeat` we should just use that instead - some providers have it stubbed though.\r\n- In specific, I cannot replicate this issue using Postgres as a brew service. even when totally offline, the timeout is basically zero.\r\n\r\n**However** the biggest thing that we can do to allow people to override the timeout with no code change on our end is to have the user just add it in [their connection string](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/connection-string-parameters.html).\r\n\r\nAdding `Timeout=30;` or `Command Timeout=30;` as connection string vars would suffice without us having to implement code we need to maintain. The `pg` code would handle this as is currently.",

It now uses a much more robust method of parsing the content into \"thinking\" and \"normal\" parts, and then renders them as separate React components. This approach avoids all the previous issues with string manipulation and HTML escaping, ensuring that the markdown is rendered correctly and reliably.\r\n\r\n2. __Improved \"Thinking\" View:__\r\n\r\n   - __Problem:__ The initial styling for the \"thinking\" text was not being applied correctly to multi-line content.\r\n   - __Solution:__ With the new rendering approach, the \"thinking\" text is now correctly wrapped in a styled component, ensuring that the blue color is applied to the entire block of text, regardless of how many lines it contains. A line break is also consistently added to separate it from the main response.\r\n\r\nThese refinements have significantly improved the stability and reliability of the new features, providing a much smoother and more polished user experience.",

The translations are normalized, so there won't be any issue in another language but the values are set to null after I ran normalizeEn.mjs\r\n\r\nOkay so this will take a little more work to get this complete now. But as you can see after normalizing and linting all the files it makes it much easier to see what is being changed.\r\n\r\nYou are correct that all these keys are null in other languages and this is the problem with moving the existing keys around. The reason is because the normalize script is just checking all other translation files to ensure they contain the same structure as the English translations. If the keys are different, the script will automatically create matching keys by default and set them to null. In your PR it makes complete sense for moving these keys around and makes the translations structured better. \r\n\r\nWhat you will need to do in order to ensure we do not lose our existing translations from these files is to manually fill each one of the new null keys in with the previous translations. You can do this by opening the files changed tab in this PR and just copy manually each key to the new keys that were created. Once this is done we can get it merged in. Great work so far on your first contribution!",

Keep in mind I do not use this tooling daily, nor am I an expert in this\r\n\r\n@timothycarambat - I\u2019d like to propose to introduce an official Helm chart repository for AnythingLLM.\r\n\r\nThe benefit here is that users who want to self-host or deploy to Kubernetes could install and manage AnythingLLM with Helm, which is one of the most common deployment tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, a Helm repository is just a simple HTTP server that hosts an index.yaml file listing available charts ([Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/)). Many open-source projects use GitHub Pages to host this.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nhelm repo add anythingllm-repo https://mintplex-labs.github.io/helm-charts\r\nhelm repo update\r\nhelm install release-name anythingllm-repo/anythingllm --version 1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Proposed approach:**\r\n\r\n- Create a dedicated repo in the _Mintplex-Labs_ org `(e.g. mintplex-labs/helm-charts)`\r\n- Use a `gh-pages` branch to host the index.yaml via GitHub Pages\r\n- Add a GitHub Actions workflow to package charts, publish .tgz files as releases, and update the repo index automatically\r\n- Add the Helm Chart to https://artifacthub.io/ (Think Docker Hub)\r\n\r\nThis pattern is widely adopted across open-source projects.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d be happy to help with this. In my day job I work with Kubernetes across different environments (cloud and on-prem) and I\u2019ve had quite a bit of experience creating and maintaining Helm charts.\r\n\r\nI recently migrated the company I work for from OpenWeb UI to AnythingLLM. The response from the teams after a demo was really positive. I think there\u2019s a lot of potential for AnythingLLM to grow in this space, and having an official Helm chart repo would make adoption even easier for other teams.",

Not a big red failure in chat.\r\n- The idea of doing a pre-check is actually very useful, since all of the providers have a `heartbeat` we should just use that instead - some providers have it stubbed though.\r\n- In specific, I cannot replicate this issue using Postgres as a brew service. even when totally offline, the timeout is basically zero.\r\n\r\n**However** the biggest thing that we can do to allow people to override the timeout with no code change on our end is to have the user just add it in [their connection string](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/connection-string-parameters.html).\r\n\r\nAdding `Timeout=30;` or `Command Timeout=30;` as connection string vars would suffice without us having to implement code we need to maintain.

Then i type `/` again, my new preset is unreachable via keyboard nav (because qty state is out of sync probably).

This would make counting results on the fly easy, work on all cases, and when pressing enter all the logic we have around clicking the item would take over - simplifying things a lot (maybe?) ;)\r\n\r\nFixes in [3e85053](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/pull/4402/commits/3e85053755a50e7aecb3e54a2aef49c15deb4a93)\r\n\r\n1. I abstracted most of the logic related to slash commands into the custom hook `useSlashCommands` to keep the `PromptInput` comp as light as possible.\r\n2. I fixed the bug when the slash command popup would be triggered via the slash command button and wouldn't respond keyboard navigation/selection\r\n3. I also found a bug in the process where if a user had enough slash commands to cause vertical overflow, out of view slash commands would be highlighted but not visible, I added scroll-into-view logic when a slash command is highlighted.\r\n4. The bug where newly created slash commands would not be highlightable/selectable is now fixed.",

It now uses a much more robust method of parsing the content into \"thinking\" and \"normal\" parts, and then renders them as separate React components. This approach avoids all the previous issues with string manipulation and HTML escaping, ensuring that the markdown is rendered correctly and reliably.\r\n\r\n2. __Improved \"Thinking\" View:__\r\n\r\n   - __Problem:__ The initial styling for the \"thinking\" text was not being applied correctly to multi-line content.\r\n   - __Solution:__ With the new rendering approach, the \"thinking\" text is now correctly wrapped in a styled component, ensuring that the blue color is applied to the entire block of text, regardless of how many lines it contains. A line break is also consistently added to separate it from the main response.\r\n\r\nThese refinements have significantly improved the stability and reliability of the new features, providing a much smoother and more polished user experience.",

The translations are normalized, so there won't be any issue in another language but the values are set to null after I ran normalizeEn.mjs\r\n\r\nOkay so this will take a little more work to get this complete now. But as you can see after normalizing and linting all the files it makes it much easier to see what is being changed.\r\n\r\nYou are correct that all these keys are null in other languages and this is the problem with moving the existing keys around. The reason is because the normalize script is just checking all other translation files to ensure they contain the same structure as the English translations. If the keys are different, the script will automatically create matching keys by default and set them to null. In your PR it makes complete sense for moving these keys around and makes the translations structured better. \r\n\r\nWhat you will need to do in order to ensure we do not lose our existing translations from these files is to manually fill each one of the new null keys in with the previous translations. You can do this by opening the files changed tab in this PR and just copy manually each key to the new keys that were created. Once this is done we can get it merged in. Great work so far on your first contribution!",

Keep in mind I do not use this tooling daily, nor am I an expert in this\r\n\r\n@timothycarambat - I\u2019d like to propose to introduce an official Helm chart repository for AnythingLLM.\r\n\r\nThe benefit here is that users who want to self-host or deploy to Kubernetes could install and manage AnythingLLM with Helm, which is one of the most common deployment tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, a Helm repository is just a simple HTTP server that hosts an index.yaml file listing available charts ([Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/)). Many open-source projects use GitHub Pages to host this.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nhelm repo add anythingllm-repo https://mintplex-labs.github.io/helm-charts\r\nhelm repo update\r\nhelm install release-name anythingllm-repo/anythingllm --version 1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Proposed approach:**\r\n\r\n- Create a dedicated repo in the _Mintplex-Labs_ org `(e.g. mintplex-labs/helm-charts)`\r\n- Use a `gh-pages` branch to host the index.yaml via GitHub Pages\r\n- Add a GitHub Actions workflow to package charts, publish .tgz files as releases, and update the repo index automatically\r\n- Add the Helm Chart to https://artifacthub.io/ (Think Docker Hub)\r\n\r\nThis pattern is widely adopted across open-source projects.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d be happy to help with this. In my day job I work with Kubernetes across different environments (cloud and on-prem) and I\u2019ve had quite a bit of experience creating and maintaining Helm charts.\r\n\r\nI recently migrated the company I work for from OpenWeb UI to AnythingLLM. The response from the teams after a demo was really positive. I think there\u2019s a lot of potential for AnythingLLM to grow in this space, and having an official Helm chart repo would make adoption even easier for other teams.",

Maybe for the first step I make that empty repo so that the work doesnt get crossed and mixed up between repos and then we can backlink it to the main repo and vice versa.\r\n\r\nReally awesome and I would greatly appreciate the help with that as it is certainly not my domain expertise.\r\n\r\n[Here is the new empty repo if you do have the time to contribute](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/helm-charts) Once we have a YAML to serve Ill enable GH Pages to serve from whatever directory we need to so that it can resolve for users who want to use this service/arch.",

Not a big red failure in chat.\r\n- The idea of doing a pre-check is actually very useful, since all of the providers have a `heartbeat` we should just use that instead - some providers have it stubbed though.\r\n- In specific, I cannot replicate this issue using Postgres as a brew service. even when totally offline, the timeout is basically zero.\r\n\r\n**However** the biggest thing that we can do to allow people to override the timeout with no code change on our end is to have the user just add it in [their connection string](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/connection-string-parameters.html).\r\n\r\nAdding `Timeout=30;` or `Command Timeout=30;` as connection string vars would suffice without us having to implement code we need to maintain.

It now uses a much more robust method of parsing the content into \"thinking\" and \"normal\" parts, and then renders them as separate React components. This approach avoids all the previous issues with string manipulation and HTML escaping, ensuring that the markdown is rendered correctly and reliably.\r\n\r\n2. __Improved \"Thinking\" View:__\r\n\r\n   - __Problem:__ The initial styling for the \"thinking\" text was not being applied correctly to multi-line content.\r\n   - __Solution:__ With the new rendering approach, the \"thinking\" text is now correctly wrapped in a styled component, ensuring that the blue color is applied to the entire block of text, regardless of how many lines it contains. A line break is also consistently added to separate it from the main response.\r\n\r\nThese refinements have significantly improved the stability and reliability of the new features, providing a much smoother and more polished user experience.",

The translations are normalized, so there won't be any issue in another language but the values are set to null after I ran normalizeEn.mjs\r\n\r\nOkay so this will take a little more work to get this complete now. But as you can see after normalizing and linting all the files it makes it much easier to see what is being changed.\r\n\r\nYou are correct that all these keys are null in other languages and this is the problem with moving the existing keys around. The reason is because the normalize script is just checking all other translation files to ensure they contain the same structure as the English translations. If the keys are different, the script will automatically create matching keys by default and set them to null. In your PR it makes complete sense for moving these keys around and makes the translations structured better. \r\n\r\nWhat you will need to do in order to ensure we do not lose our existing translations from these files is to manually fill each one of the new null keys in with the previous translations. You can do this by opening the files changed tab in this PR and just copy manually each key to the new keys that were created. Once this is done we can get it merged in. Great work so far on your first contribution!",
